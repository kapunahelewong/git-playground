# Git and Github Playground

This is a repo intended as a safe place to practice your git skills. You can do all kinds of things, such as:

* Open an issue.
* Respond to someone else's issue.
* Open an issue just to close it.
* Clone this repo.
* Open a PR.
* Leave comments on issues and PRs.
* Make a number of commits on your computer, push them up to see them listed in your PR (assuming you've submitted one), try squashing them, rebasing, etc., and push up to see the results.
* Open a PR just to close it.
* Tag me for a review.
* Submit a PR with a code of conduct, a story (keep it public domain, please), a picture (same thing about public domain), etc.
* Maintain a fork and rebase it every once in a while.
* Collaborate with someone.
* Checkout the [issues](https://github.com/kapunahelewong/git-playground/issues) for more ideas on types of PRs to submit.
* Open an issue with an idea!

You don't have to submit code or anything technical.
It can be just a note saying hi, or something as simple as a typo fix. Or hey, how about a typo for someone else to fix?! ðŸ˜Š

## Git Playground Spotlight

When your PR is merged, you'll automatically appear in the [Git Playground Spotlight](https://cutiko.github.io/git-playground-spotlight/), as built by the most excellent @cutiko!ðŸŽ‰


## New

Just added: Pet Pics! Add a photo of your favorite pet to the `pet-pics` folder and add it to the `pet-pics.md` file, following my example. I've started with my little dog, Pepper. Here's a preview!

![Pepper](pet-pics/Pepper.png)

Look at her^^. She's serious about play, perfect for our Git Playground!!

## Code of conduct

I'll start:

* Be kind. <-seriously
* Material must be your original work or public domain.
* Anything that gets merged here falls under the GNU General Public License.

We'll need more than this, but it's a start.

Finally, **please keep PRs small and simple** &mdash; it's just me over here!
